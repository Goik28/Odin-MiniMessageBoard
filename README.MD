# Mini Messageboard
This is my take on the "Mini Message Board" project from "The Odin Project", NodeJS course.

## The Objective
To create a nodeJS application that posts and display messages using the basic of express routing.

## No Styling
It wasn't added any styling to this project so it's ugly.
